Introduction
In this Industry Capstone, you will work as an AI Engineer or Applied AI Consultant inside a company. The organization wants to deploy an AI agent that can assist users in real workflows — handling ambiguity, reasoning across steps, using tools, learning from feedback, and operating safely in production.

Your responsibility is to design, build, test, iterate, and justify an AI agent as it would be done in an industry setting, not as a one-off prototype.

 

Problem Statement
You must design an AI agent that supports a realistic business workflow in one chosen industry scenario. The agent should demonstrate reliability, explainability, safety-first behaviour, and practical usefulness for real users, with evidence through artefacts and test logs.

Your final submission should make it clear:

who the user is and what workflow the agent supports,
what success looks like (criteria + metrics),
what failures you anticipated and how you handled them,
and why your architecture/design decisions are justified.
 

Framework Requirement
Choose one of the following tracks:

Track A — Framework-Based: LangChain OR CrewAI OR Flowise.
Track B — Framework-Free: You must justify your architecture and show equivalent capabilities.
Note: If you choose Flowise, your build may be completed on Flowise (cloud or local). Flowise builds typically cannot be executed inside the Vocareum notebook environment, but you may still use Vocareum for course guidance and support resources.

 

Industry Scenarios (Choose ONE)
Select one scenario below and build your agent to meet the stated safety requirements.

Scenario 1: Business Operations — AI Operations Copilot (Decision Support Only)
Safety Requirements:

Must refuse requests to modify data or trigger actions.
Must explain uncertainty instead of guessing.
Must provide escalation to a human analyst.
Must not store sensitive business data in logs.
Scenario 2: Banking — AI Banking Support & Advisory Agent (Non-Transactional)
Safety Requirements:

Must refuse money movement, approvals, or legal advice.
Must not hallucinate customer data.
Must escalate ambiguous or high-risk cases.
Must not store PII in logs.
Scenario 3: Customer Support — AI Support Resolution Agent
Safety Requirements:

Must refuse unsafe or policy-violating requests.
Must not fabricate policies.
Must escalate sensitive or unresolved cases.
Must not store personal data in logs.
 

Task to be performed
You will build the agent following an industry workflow across the phases below. Your submission must include clear evidence (screenshots/logs/tables/artefacts) for the key capabilities.

 

Phase 1: Understand the Problem & Define Success
Coding: Not Required (optional)

Tools/Skills: Problem framing, user persona definition, workflow mapping, requirements writing, success criteria, edge-case thinking, evaluation planning

Identify the primary user persona and daily workflow

Write 3–5 example user questions
Define success criteria
List known failure cases and edge scenarios
 

Phase 2: Build a Basic Working Agent
Coding: Required

Tools/Skills: Python, CLI or notebook workflow, input/output handling, basic rules/templates, logging sample runs

Create a Python-based agent

Demonstrate baseline limitations
Tasks

Create a Python-based agent that accepts user input
Implement basic response generation (rules or templates)
Demonstrate at least 2 limitations of the baseline agent
Log sample interactions and responses
Explain why this version is insufficient for real users
 

Phase 3: Make the Agent Smarter
Coding: Required

Tools/Skills: LLM integration (provider API), prompt engineering, prompt versioning, structured comparison of outputs, error/failure analysis

Experiment with prompt strategies
Show how behaviour changes with better prompts
Tasks

Demonstrate correct vs incorrect tool usage
Add safeguards
Tasks

Define at least two tools the agent can use
Implement tool calling logic

Deliverables
Your final submission package must include:

Problem Framing Document (1–2 pages)
Demo Script (3–5 forced interactions)
Evaluation Report
Engineering & Product Justification
 

Evaluation Checklist
You are evaluated on engineering judgment, reliability, explainability, safety-first design, and practical usefulness in real workflows — not unnecessary complexity or academic novelty.

Minimum Bar (Required Evidence):

Problem framing document
Forced demo script
Retrieval, tool usage, memory, and adaptation proof
Evaluation report with root cause and fix
Safety enforcement demonstration
Framework usage or justified framework-free design
Required Method (Prompt Comparison Rule): You must demonstrate prompt evaluation using the same test set, 2–3 prompt variants, and a comparison table (Prompt → Output → What Improved/Worsened).

 

How to Approach the Project
Build your capstone like an industry project: define success, ship a baseline, iterate with evidence, and document tradeoffs. Your artifacts should make your decisions easy to evaluate.

Start with a clear persona + workflow and define success criteria early.
Show the evolution: baseline → LLM → retrieval → tools → memory/planning → adaptation.
Use logs/screenshots/tables as evidence — not just narrative claims.
Demonstrate at least one failure case with root cause and a fix (before/after proof).
Treat safety as a feature: refusals, uncertainty, escalation, and PII-safe logging.
 

Practice Guidelines
You may develop in your preferred environment (local or cloud) as long as your agent is reproducible and your submission includes complete evidence. If you are using an LLM provider (for example, the OpenAI API), ensure keys are handled securely and never exposed in shared files.

To Use Chat Support for This Assignment (inside Vocareum):

Open your practice notebook in Vocareum. Use the left sidebar to open the Assistant panel.
Ask for clarifications, troubleshooting help, or prompt-writing support in the Assistant chat.
Monitor your GenAI Allowance/Budget, as shown in the Assistant panel, and plan prompts accordingly.
If you exhaust your allowance for a task, please contact the Emeritus support team.
API key access: Your course-specific API key and usage notes are provided via the guide and Vocareum instructions. Follow those steps to locate your key when needed.
You can find detailed instructions here: Vocareum_GenAI_API_Students_Guide.pdfDownload Vocareum_GenAI_API_Students_Guide.pdf
Security warning: Keep your API key private. Do not paste it in screenshots, chats, notebooks you share, or public repos. Prefer environment variables or secure key fields in tools; never hard-code keys in shared files. If you suspect exposure, rotate the key immediately per the guide.
